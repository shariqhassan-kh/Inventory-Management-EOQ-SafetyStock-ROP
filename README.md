# Inventory-Management-EOQ-SafetyStock-ROP
EOQ, Safety Stock, Reorder Point, and demand variability calculations for supply chain inventory planning.

**Inventory Management – EOQ, Safety Stock & ROP**
📌 **Project Overview**
This project focuses on core inventory planning techniques used in supply chain management, including EOQ, Reorder Point, Safety Stock, and demand variability analysis. It demonstrates how inventory decisions balance holding cost, ordering cost, and stockout risk.

📦 **Concepts Covered**
**EOQ (Economic Order Quantity)
ROP (Reorder Point)
Safety Stock Calculation
Demand Variability
Lead Time Uncertainty
Service Level Based Planning
Newsvendor & Critical Ratio Concepts**

🧮 **Key Calculations**
EOQ = √(2DS / H)
Safety Stock = Z × σ × √LT
ROP = (Average Demand × Lead Time) + Safety Stock
Demand variability scenarios (high/low)
Optimal order quantity vs stockout cost

📁 **Files Included**

🧠 **Key Insights**
EOQ helps balance ordering and holding costs
Higher demand variability requires more safety stock
ROP ensures orders are placed before stock runs out
Service level directly impacts buffer stock
Inventory planning reduces uncertainty and improves fulfilment rates
